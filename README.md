# Social Network API-MongoDB


This project is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. It is built using Express.js for routing, MongoDB for the database, and Mongoose as the ODM (Object Data Modeling) library.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/social-network-api.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd social-network-api`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

1. Start the MongoDB server.
2. Run the application: `npm start`
3. The API will be available at: `http://localhost:3001`

## Technologies Used

- [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express): Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): A popular NoSQL database for handling large amounts of data with flexibility.
- [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose): A MongoDB ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for Node.js.

## Acceptance Criteria

The following acceptance criteria should be met by the API:

- Users can create, update, and delete their own thoughts.
- Users can react to other users' thoughts.
- Users can add and remove friends from their friend list.

## Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas for future enhancements:

- Implement authentication and authorization to secure the API.
- Add features like user profiles, notifications, or image uploads.
- Improve error handling and validation for robustness.

Feel free to explore and extend the functionality of the API as per your requirements.
